## Rofi-Obsidian

- A simple rofi script to quick capture tasks in your [Obsidian](https://obsidian.md/) vault. In tandem with the [Tasks Community Plugin](https://publish.obsidian.md/tasks/Introduction), you can use this script to add Tasks anywhere in your desktop with a key bind and your Task Plugin Configuration will handle the rest.
